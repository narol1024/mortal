# Mortal

Nowadays, the available MVP (Minimum Viable Product) has been published. You can experience it here: https://mortal-fawn.vercel.app/. 

Actually, the motivations for creating this app are as follows:

- In memory of [Mortal](https://www.baike.com/wikiid/7353255952306618408), a cancer patient who still loved her life.
- As a tiny project, it aims to enhance my skills and become more familiar with Vercel platform.


## Features

- Signing up account.
- Logging in using secret key.
- Posting amazing moment in your life.
- Browsing recent news feeds by each Mortal.

## Next Plans

- Adding visual elements, such as pinning the thumbnail on the globe. 
- Showing the number of currently online accounts.
- Migrating this project to AliCloud if possible, since it's not available within China.

More ideas are constantly being ejecting.🤔
